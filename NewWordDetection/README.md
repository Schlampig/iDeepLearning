  * Authors: [Xylander23](https://github.com/xylander23/New-Word-Detection) is the original author, and then [Lyrichu](https://github.com/Lyrichu/NewWordDetection) modified the code to python3 version.

### Usage:
  * Prepare a stop-words dictionary file named ".txt".
  * Prepare the target document file named ".txt" (more words, better performance since this is a unsupervised statistic method).
  * Put both files under the same folder with the code ".py"
  * Run the code to generate a result file named ".csv".
  * Check new discovered words listed in the result file.
