Introduction
============
A-softmax loss (in SphereFace) rather than so-called sphere loss has been introduced into the baseline model instead of softmax loss or other common loss.

    1. The keras codes here to implement a-softmax loss into a model are original. Use them freely. I think it might not work well, because I never use labels information during the loss calculation.
    2. Please read introductions about baseline and center_loss to know how to use these codes 
    3. I will be glad if you could cite this link, star it or give me a feed back!
